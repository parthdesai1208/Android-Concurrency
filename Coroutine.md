Asynchronous programming made easy

## Why we use it?
Here are some of the reasons why you might want to use: 
- to easily write concurrent code without having to manage threads directly
- better readability and maintainability
- get rid of traditional callback-based approaches
- easily pause & resume operation

## Features

- Asynchronous programming: Kotlin coroutines allow you to write asynchronous code in a synchronous style, which makes it easier to reason about and less error-prone.
- Lightweight: Kotlin coroutines are lightweight threads that can be created and destroyed quickly, which makes them ideal for use in applications with a large number of concurrent tasks.
- Cancellation: Kotlin coroutines can be cancelled at any time, which allows for efficient resource management and helps prevent memory leaks.
- Structured concurrency: Kotlin coroutines provide a structured concurrency model, which ensures that all child coroutines are cancelled when a parent coroutine is cancelled.
- Suspending functions: Kotlin coroutines use suspending functions, which can be paused and resumed at any time, allowing for more efficient use of system resources.
- Coroutine builders: Kotlin provides several coroutine builders, including launch, async, and runBlocking, which make it easy to create and manage coroutines.
- Coroutine scopes: Kotlin coroutines can be created within a specific scope, which helps manage their lifecycle and ensures they are cancelled when they are no longer needed.

## Dependency
```sh
implementation "org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core:core_version"
implementation "org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-android:android_version"
```
[core_version](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.jetbrains.kotlinx/kotlix-coroutines-core)
[android_version](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.jetbrains.kotlinx/kotlinx-coroutines-android)

## Suspend 
Suspend function is a function that could be started, paused, and resume. means it doesnâ€™t block the Thread, but release the Thread for the other coroutine to continue its work, and regain it back as the Thread is released.

>Only allowed to be called from a coroutine or another suspend function

## launch
- Used to start the coroutines
- returns a Job and does not carry any resulting value
>it's like fire and forget

#### UseCase - Just calling APIs & not worry about return result
```sh
 CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.IO).launch {
  //we will learn about Dispatchers.IO in coming section
            launch {
                Log.e(tag,API1())
            }
            launch {
                Log.e(tag,API2())
            }
            launch {
                Log.e(tag,API3())
            }
        }
    private suspend fun API1(): String {
        delay(2000)
        return "API1 Response"
    }

    private suspend fun API2(): String {
        delay(4000)
        return "API2 Response"
    }

    private suspend fun API3(): String {
        delay(1000)
        return "API3 Response"
    }   
//API3 Response    //after 1 second it will print
//API1 Response    //after 2 second it will print
//API2 Response    //after 4 second it will print
```



## async
- Used to start the coroutines
-  returns an instance of Deferred<T>, which has an await() function that returns the result of the coroutine
>perform a task and return a result

#### UseCase - Multiple API calls depends on each other
```sh
 CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.IO).launch {
            val APICall1 = async {
                API1()
            }
            val APICall2 = async {
                API2()
            }
            val APICall3 = async {
                API3()
            }
            val api1 = APICall1.await()
            val api2 = APICall2.await()
            val api3 = APICall3.await()
            Log.e(tag,"$api1 $api2 $api3")
        }
        
//API1 Response API2 Response API3 Response
//after all 3 API return the string it will print it's result
//all 3 jobs will wait for each other to finish
```

## runBlocking
- Runs a new coroutine and blocks the current thread until its completion.
- It is designed to actually write blocking code to libraries that are written in suspending style.
- To be used in main functions and in tests.

```sh
CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.IO).launch {
        Log.e(tag, "other thread is started working")
        delay(4000)
        Log.e(tag, "other thread is completed")
}
runBlocking {
        launch {
            Log.e(tag, API1())
        }
        launch {
            Log.e(tag, API2())
        }
        launch {
            Log.e(tag, API3())
        }
}
//other thread is started working
//API3 Response                     //after 1 second it will print
//API1 Response                     //after 2 second it will print
//API2 Response                     //after 4 second it will print
//other thread is completed         
//wait, why its printing after runBlocking{} block
//because runBlocking{} blocks other thread, 
//execute its child job & release that thread
```

## withContext
- Allows you to switch the context of a coroutine while preserving its job and continuation

```sh
CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Main).launch {
    Log.e(tag, "Before withContext: Running on ${Thread.currentThread().name}")
    withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
        Log.e(tag, "Inside withContext with Dispatchers.IO: Running on ${Thread.currentThread().name}")
    }
    Log.e(tag, "After withContext: Running on ${Thread.currentThread().name}")
}
//Before withContext: Running on main
//Inside withContext with Dispatchers.IO: Running on DefaultDispatcher-worker-1
//After withContext: Running on main
```
> As you can see, 
before withContext it was running on main thread, but with the use of withContext it was running in worker thread-1 

## Coroutine context
We have three types of context in Coroutines
#### 1.Dispatchers.Main 
This dispatcher is designed to be used with user interface elements in Android applications. It runs coroutines on the main thread.

#### 2.Dispatchers. io
This dispatcher is optimized for performing IO operations, such as reading from or writing to a file or a network socket

#### 3.Dispatchers.Default
This dispatcher is used by default if no other dispatcher is specified. It is backed by a shared pool of threads.

## Job
Every coroutine is associated with a job, which is created automatically when the coroutine is launched.
##### A coroutine job has several important properties:
- It can be cancelled using `cancel()` method
- It has a completion state: "active", "completed", or "cancelled". Queried using the `isActive`, `isCompleted`, and `isCancelled` properties.
- It can have children: A coroutine job can have child jobs, which are automatically cancelled when the parent job is cancelled or completed.
```sh
val exception = CoroutineExceptionHandler { coroutineContext, throwable ->
    Log.e(tag,throwable.message.toString())
}

val scope = CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.IO + Job() + exception)
scope.launch {
    scope.launch {
        Log.e(tag, API1())
    }
    scope.launch {
        Log.e(tag, API2())
    }
    scope.launch {
        Log.e(tag, API3())
    }
}
        
//API3 Response        
//API1 failed 
//now what about API2 Response? 
//because Job() not handled exception of child jobs very well & it will cancel the parent job too.
//to tackle this scenario we have SupervisorJob().
```

## SupervisorJob

if we use `SupervisorJob()` instead of `Job()` in above code,

```sh
val scope = CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.IO + SupervisorJob() + exception)
```

We have now output like this,
API3 Response
API1 failed
API2 Response //for this time we have API2 response

## Scope

A coroutine scope is an object that manages the lifecycle of a set of coroutines, that means coroutines launched in this scope will be cancelled when the scope is cancelled.

### Type of scopes

**1.GlobalScope**
This is a predefined coroutine scope that is available throughout the application.
```sh
GlobalScope.launch {
    //task
}
```
**2.CoroutineScope**
This is a custom coroutine scope that is created by the developer.
```sh
CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.IO).launch{
    //task
}
```
**3.lifecycleScope**
comes with [lifecycle ktx](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/androidx.lifecycle/lifecycle-runtime-ktx?repo=google) & part of [Lifecycle-aware coroutine scopes](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/coroutines#lifecycle-aware)
used in activity to launch a coroutine
```sh
 lifecycleScope.launch {
    //task
 }
```
**4.viewModelScope**
comes with [lifecycle viewmodel ktx](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/androidx.lifecycle/lifecycle-viewmodel-ktx) & part of [Lifecycle-aware coroutine scopes](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/coroutines#lifecycle-aware)
used in ViewModel to lanch a coroutine
```sh
viewModelScope.launch {
    // Coroutine that will be canceled when the ViewModel is cleared.
}
```

> Bonus tip => you can use [Restartable Lifecycle-aware coroutines](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/coroutines#restart)
> Even though the lifecycleScope provides a proper way to cancel long-running operations automatically when the Lifecycle is DESTROYED.
> You might want to collect a flow when the Lifecycle is STARTED and cancel the collection when it's STOPPED.

**5.coroutineScope**
When any child coroutine in this scope fails, this scope fails and all the rest of the children are cancelled.
```sh
runBlocking {
        try {
            coroutineScope {
                launch {
                    Log.e(tag, API1())
                }
                launch {
                    Log.e(tag, API2())
                }
                launch {
                    Log.e(tag, API3())
                }
            }
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            Log.e(tag, "catch block")
        }
}
//API3 Response
//catch block
```
> Note here API2 response isn't recorded. 

**6.supervisorScope**
Creates a CoroutineScope with SupervisorJob.
a failure of a child does not cause this scope to fail and does not affect its other children,
```sh
runBlocking {
    supervisorScope {
        launch {
            try {
                Log.e(tag, API1())
            } catch (e: Exception) {
                Log.e(tag, "catch block")
            }
        }
        launch {
            Log.e(tag, API2())
        }
        launch {
            Log.e(tag, API3())
        }
    }
}
//API3 Response
//catch block
//API2 Response     //for this time we have API2 response
```

## suspendCoroutine
- Used for converting legacy callback methods to suspend function

Suppose, we have legacy code like this,
```sh
fun getUser(id: String, callback: (User) -> Unit) {...}
//we had callback hell like this,
Api.getUser(id) { user ->
      Api.getProfile(user) { profile ->
          Api.downloadImage(profile.imageId) { image ->
              // ...
          }
      } 
}
//in order to use this method inside coroutine we have suspendCoroutine

suspend fun getUser(id: String): User  = suspendCoroutine { continuation ->
      Api.getUser(id) { user ->
          continuation.resume(user)
      }
}

//inside coroutine we can use it like this,
runBlocking {
    val user = getUser(id)    
}
```

## suspendCancellableCoroutine
Like `suspendCoroutine`, `suspendCancellableCoroutine` provides a bridge between the coroutine world and the callback world but also provide the ability to cancel the coroutine.

```sh
private suspend fun fetchUser(): User = suspendCancellableCoroutine { 
cancellableContinuation ->
  ...
  // We call "contiuation.cancel()" to cancel this suspend function.
  cancellableContinuation.cancel()
  ...
}
//we can use it like,

runBlocking {
        try {
           val user = fetchUser()
           updateUser(user)    
        } catch (exception: Exception) {
           //we get java.util.concurrent.CancellationException here
        }
}

```
